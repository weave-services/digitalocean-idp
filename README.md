## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables**  
   Configure your DigitalOcean API token and project name by copying .env.example to .env:
   ```bash
   DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN="<your DigitalOcean token>"
   DIGITALOCEAN_PROJECT_NAME="<your project name>"
   DROPLET_ROOT_PASSWORD="<your droplet root pass>"
   ```
   > **Note**: This setup will deploy across all droplets within your specified project.
   
   If you use Namecheap for domain management, enable automatic DNS updates by providing these variables:
   ```bash
   NAMECHEAP_API_KEY="<your Namecheap API key>"
   NAMECHEAP_IP="<your IP address>"
   NAMECHEAP_USERNAME="<your Namecheap username>"
